# 🌿 Leaf Disease Detection using CNN

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify plant leaf images and detect potential diseases. It was developed as part of a machine learning course during a summer school program.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Automatically classify leaf images into different disease categories or mark them as healthy.
- **Model Used:** Custom CNN built and trained using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Dataset:** A subset of the publicly available PlantVillage dataset.
- **Tools & Libraries:** Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn.

## 🗃️ Dataset Description

- The dataset consists of images of plant leaves categorized into various diseases and healthy leaves.
- Sample classes:
  - `Tomato - Late Blight`
  - `Potato - Early Blight`
  - `Pepper - Bacterial Spot`
  - `Tomato - Healthy`, etc.
